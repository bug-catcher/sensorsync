"""Committed-fixture guard: ``data/fixtures/synth_mini_aligned`` (session 14).

Sibling of ``tests/test_fixture_synth_mini.py``. Where that fixture pins
the on-disk *run* format v0 (D-0005), this one pins the on-disk *aligned
episode* format v0 (D-0021). Regenerate with:

    embsync align data/fixtures/synth_mini \\
        --out data/fixtures/synth_mini_aligned \\
        --target-rate-hz 10.0

(from the repo root — pytest's rootdir is the same directory, so the
relative ``data/fixtures/synth_mini`` source path resolves both under
manual regeneration and under the regeneration test.)

If either the alignment engine (D-0020) or the episode format
(D-0021) changes, the byte-identity test fails and the diff must be
made deliberately. Change ``data/fixtures/README.md`` in the same
PR so the regeneration command matches the new expected bytes.
