"""Optional-dependency discipline check (NEXT_TASKS #3).

The base install of ``embodied_sync`` intentionally stays lightweight — no
``mcap``, ``lerobot``, ``pyarrow``, ``pylsl``, ``pyxdf``,
``zarr``/``numcodecs``, ``rerun``/``rerun_sdk`` at
package import time. The in-process check in
``tests/test_package.py::test_import_pulls_no_optional_dependencies``
passes trivially when those packages are not installed at all
(``sys.modules`` never contains them because ``import`` was never
attempted).

This test is the stricter version: a *subprocess* installs a
:class:`_ForbidImportsFinder` on ``sys.meta_path`` that raises
``ImportError`` for the forbidden names before ``embodied_sync`` is
imported. If a future PR adds a stray top-level ``import mcap`` (or
similar) to any module reachable from ``embodied_sync/__init__.py``, that
import will fire, hit the finder, and the subprocess will exit non-zero
— even on a developer machine where the optional dep happens to be
installed. Guards the "base install stays lightweight" rule before the
Milestone 4+ adapters land.
