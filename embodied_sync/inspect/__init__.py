"""Human-verifiable evidence for one event-train alignment.

The rest of the library measures alignments; this subpackage is where a
*person* checks one. It exists because a wrong event pairing can be
internally self-consistent: when the matcher pairs event *i* with event
*i±1*, downstream fit statistics can agree with the wrong answer.

So the page this subpackage renders does not report a better statistic.
It renders the chosen pairing beside the two the matcher rejected, at
the instants those hypotheses predict, and asks a person whether the
chosen column depicts the same moment as the reference and the
neighbours do not. That comparison is the product; everything else on
the page is context for it.

Where the dataset goes
----------------------
Behind :class:`~embodied_sync.inspect.provider.EvidenceProvider`. Media
decoding — ffmpeg, HDF5, whatever a rig needs — lives in the caller's
provider, never here, so importing this subpackage costs a base install
(numpy) and nothing else. Other datasets implement the same small provider
contract without changing the inspector.

Typical use::

    inspection = inspection_from_alignment(alignment, events_a, events_b)
    evidence = collect_evidence(inspection, reference_provider, candidate_provider)
    page = build_page(inspection, evidence, PageContext(...))
